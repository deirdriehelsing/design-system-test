## üõ† Customization

The index page is self-contained and can be customized:

### Add New Packages
Update the package grid in the HTML with new package cards following the existing pattern.

### Modify Search
The search functionality is in the embedded JavaScript and can be extended to include additional metadata.

### Update Styling
All styles are embedded in the `<style>` section and can be modified to match your brand guidelines.

### Link Integration
Update the component click handlers to link to your Storybook, documentation, or live examples:

```javascript
// Example: Link to Storybook
item.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const componentName = item.textContent;
    window.open(`/storybook/?path=/story/${componentName.toLowerCase()}`, '_blank');
});
```

## üìä Statistics

The index includes live statistics:
- **19 packages** across the monorepo
- **80+ components** available for use
- **4 theme variants** for brand customization
- **100% TypeScript** coverage

## üîÑ Maintenance

To keep the index up-to-date:

1. **Add new components** to the appropriate package cards
2. **Update component counts** in package headers
3. **Add new packages** when they are created
4. **Update theme variants** if new themes are added
5. **Refresh statistics** in the header cards

## üí° Best Practices

### For Teams Using This Index

1. **Bookmark the page** for quick reference during development
2. **Share with stakeholders** to communicate available capabilities
3. **Use search functionality** to quickly find specific components
4. **Reference package organization** when planning feature architecture
5. **Check theme variants** before creating custom styling

### For Maintenance

1. **Keep synchronized** with actual package contents
2. **Update regularly** when components are added/deprecated
3. **Test search functionality** after adding new content
4. **Validate links** if connecting to external documentation
5. **Monitor accessibility** for screen readers and keyboard navigation
