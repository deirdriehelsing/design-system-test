# Branch Management
Before starting work:
- Ensure you are on the master branch and it is up to date:
  ```bash
  git checkout master
  git pull origin master
  ```
- Create a new branch from master using the JIRA ticket key as prefix:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b TICKET-123-descriptive-name
  ```

# JIRA Workflow
When starting work on a ticket:
1. Assign the ticket to yourself
2. Move the ticket to "In Progress" status
3. Estimate story points:
   - 1 point â‰ˆ 1 day of total work
   - Include time for:
     - Development
     - Code review
     - Testing
     - Deployment
   - Round up to the nearest point for uncertainty

# Commit Guidelines
Use conventional commits format.

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- refactor: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- test: Adding or modifying tests
- chore: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

# Pull Request Conventions
- Always check for and use PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md as the template for PR content
- Prefix PR titles with the JIRA ticket number (e.g. "ACT-1234: Description")
- Ensure PR descriptions follow the template structure exactly
