# Cursor Rules Location and Format

## File Location
Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
```
.cursor/rules/
├── your-rule-name.mdc
├── another-rule.mdc
└── ...
```

## File Format
1. Use Markdown format with frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Brief description of the rule
   globs: **/*.*
   alwaysApply: false
   ---
   # Main Title

   ## Section
   - Rule point 1
   - Rule point 2
   ```

2. Avoid using YAML structure or XML-style tags
   - Don't use `<rule>` tags
   - Don't use complex YAML structures
   - Keep it simple and readable

## Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Always use .mdc extension
- Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

## Directory Structure
```
PROJECT_ROOT/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

## Prohibited Locations
Never place rule files:
- In the project root
- In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
- In any other location
