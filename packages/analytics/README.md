## Segment Key

Deciding how to share the Segment key between repositories is up to your team and how you want to track events. For new services, it's necessary to generate a new key.

To obtain the Segment write key:

1. Go to Segment Sources (you need to request access to the Varsity Tutors workspace).
2. Navigate to the desired source.
3. Copy the write key from Source -> Settings -> API Keys -> Write Key.

## Types Generation

The `generate-event-types` command generates event names and types from the tracking plan rules. See our [Confluence Docs](https://varsity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/1233879147/Generating+Event+Types) for details on how to use the command.
